## **Research Experience**

### **Semantically-Aware Diver Activity Recognition**  
**University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN** (_September 2023 - April 2023_)  
- Created a transformer-based framework for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) to analyze and recognize diver activities for effective multi-human-robot collaboration underwater.

### **Improving Autonomous Mapping and Navigation with Social Robots**  
**University of Minnesota Duluth, Duluth, MN** (_January 2021 - January 2022_)  
- Enhanced the navigation capabilities of the Pepper robot by integrating a LiDAR sensor and Jetson Nano board, boosting data transmission speed. Utilized the Robot Operating System (ROS) framework for optimization.

### **Real-time Human Fall Detection Framework**  
**University of Minnesota Duluth, Duluth, MN** (_January 2021 - January 2022_)  
- Developed a sensor fusion system with predictive capabilities to anticipate falls within a 15-minute timeframe, using wearable sensors for biometric data (heart rate, blood pressure, galvanic skin response) integrated with a neural network for real-time analysis.

### **Seizure Prediction by Deep Learning Methods**  
**K. N. Toosi University of Technology, Tehran, Iran** (_August 2020 - September 2021_)  
- Developed a seizure prediction system using machine learning techniques (MLP, CNN, LSTM, Bi-LSTM) to classify epileptic EEG signals, providing alerts to patients up to one hour before a seizure.
